# nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals Course Exercises
This repository is part of my journey towards completing [nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/nrf-connect-sdk-fundamentals/) course by [Nordic Developer Academy](https://academy.nordicsemi.com).

This self-paced online course provided me with hands-on experience in firmware development using the [nRF Connect SDK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nrf-connect-sdk), a highly extensible and feature-rich development platform by Nordic Semiconductor.

Throughout the course, I gained practical knowledge in developing portable RTOS-based applications for various Nordic Semiconductor devices, including the nRF52 and nRF53 Series. I also acquired valuable skills in interfacing with common peripherals, system blocks, and external sensors.
